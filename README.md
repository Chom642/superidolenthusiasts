# Team Name: The Super Idol Enthusiasts

# Objective
Named after the song You Who Love at 105Â°C by Ai Re, a singer from Xinjiang, our goal is to display the rich pop culture environment, such as music and art, food, standing traditions, and norms/values of Sino-Tibetan regions (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Himalayas, etc.)  in a humorous but informative manner.
